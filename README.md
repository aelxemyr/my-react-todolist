Tutorial: "A Guide to TDD a React/Redux TodoList App" from Hackernoon, found at https://hackernoon.com/a-guide-to-tdd-a-react-redux-todolist-app-part-1-b8a200bb7091
Much of what is here was either setup through create-react-app or is code transcribed from the tutorial. The tests and implementation for the undelete button and button disabling are my own, written first without help, then refactored (slightly) with guidance from the solutions in the tutorial.
